# clj_torrent

The beginnings of a BitTorrent client in Clojure.

This project is still in progress!

After I wrote my first BitTorrent client in Ruby, I thought it would be fun(!) to write one in Clojure as well. 

Features implemented:
- Connecting to tracker over HTTP
- Bencoding / decoding of handshake message
